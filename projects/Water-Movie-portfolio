My goal was to make a webpage with my partner (Calvin) through Replit using my knowledge of basic HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that I learned recently 
in Mr. Mueller's SEP class which is spectacular.


My partner and I, decided to make our webpage using the basics of Water and what it is, so we created a Movie-Webpage about water who have a agression towardss humatity. 
We worked together to accomplish our goal, each of us worked on different parts of the coding, we kept in contact throughout the entire project to ensure we had reached all the 
requirements necessary to score a 100.

So far we Have made a story regarding water in its purest form its abilities are about making water sea creatures and rain clouds and waves. Its role is its mad at humanity on how its being treated

The challenges we faced so far is image frame and we are still on the same problem we have done many ways to improve and its working so far. Another challenge we faced is the borderout line a thing for where to 
put the images in this picture it took us a long time to figure it out until we found the nessarry line of code to do it. Together me and calvin have worked and communicate to work
for what needed to be done in our challenges. I was able to reach out to calvin on what issues needed to be solved and it worked it very well we were able to help each other for the things 
we are looking for our struggles being solved as a team! Here is a image on what is one a movie (sneak Peak)
