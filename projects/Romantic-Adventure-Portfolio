###My goal was to make a webpage with my partner Astrid through ide and merging in Mr Mueller Class.

###During the weeks with coding our project me and my partner astrid has made a movie project about our romantic adventure a reality. We got creative and made the code and merging. We continued making our adventure with characters with characters consist of cole, evelyn and Ashton to see which path you will take on who you will date. We talked and kept into chat witheach other and to check on what we did. 

###The only challenges we had to face was git pulling where is would sometimes not work and gives us a issue luckly we worked together to find the issue and we would had to fix our git commands and make a link properly for say "Yes" option we had to check back and forth on how to do it properly. I learned that collaberation with your partners is probably one of the best things people will get from achieving their work. Partnerships are one of the many keys to even make friendships and be on good terms with others. Apon doing the project I learned also how to properly add links which had gave me the idea on how to add images such as this one.
